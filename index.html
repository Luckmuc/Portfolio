            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 13 year old teenager (born 2012, maybe this website won't be up to date when you're viewing it) and I really like tech,<br> especially software.</p>
            <p>You may have already seen me in the <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com" target="_blank">Hack Club Slack</a>, I'm <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U091H6KD6TG">@Luckmuc</a> there</p>
            <p>I participated in <a href="https://summer.hackclub.com" target="_blank">Summer of Making</a>, a really nice program and i got a Bambu Lab A1 mini there</p><img src="pictures/som_logo.png" alt="Summer of Making Logo">
            <p>Fitting to that, i joined the printing legion of Hackclub to help out others without a 3D printer</p><img src="pictures/bambulab_nobg.png" alt="Bambu Lab A1 mini picture">

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>I don't really have many public projects, mostly because I'm really bad at coding or i just do it private (I'm a vibecoder, but surprise: This website isnt vibecoded)</p>
            <p>But one of the few public projects I have is <a href="https://github.com/Luckmuc/Blockpanel">Blockpanel</a>, a Minecraft Server Manager working with Purpur (vibecoded)</p><img src="pictures/blockpanel-logo.png" alt="Blockpanel Logo">
            <p>This website is also public and open source btw, I'm also participating in Blueprint, so there may will be some Repos from that :)</p>
